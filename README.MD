TriColor-Wars is an Open source game, built on top of https://github.com/slicer4ever/Lightwave

This game was made for https://gamedev.net/ Arcade Battle Arena Challenge! (https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/692485-october-2017-gamedev-challenge-arcade-battle-arena/)

This game supports local multiplayer with the use of splitting the keyboard and mouse, as it is built for a challenge i am alloting myself 48 hours for total completion.

The overall game design is a single/multiplayer asteroid type game played on one screen.
The goal is to switch colors to break the shields of the enemys floating through space, then destroy them when you have no colors equipped, matching the color to the shield.  But be careful in multiplayer you might open up your opponent to stealing your kills if your not careful.
With that in mind, let's see what we can do in 48 hours!

The 48 hours is up, and this is what i reached.  Overall I'm happy with my progress, it's not quite as much as i wanted, but it both meets the requirements of this challenge, and mechanically the idea's i wanted to play out.  overall i find it decently fun, I think if i dedicated more time to ai variety and wave tuning it could be more fun.  Ultimately i'm happy with what i was able to do in my self imposed limits.  I hope my work can be a learning experiance for others some day.
